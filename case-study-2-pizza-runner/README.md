# Case Study #2 - Pizza Runner
## **Table 1: runners**
The `runners` table shows the registration_date for each new runner

| runner_id | registration_date |
|-----------|-------------------|
| 1         | 2021-01-01        |
| 2         | 2021-01-03        |
| 3         | 2021-01-08        |
| 4         | 2021-01-15        |


## **Table 2: customer_orders**
The `customer_orders` table records pizza orders from customers, with each row representing an individual pizza in the order.

- The `pizza_id` column indicates the type of pizza ordered.
- The `exclusions` column lists the IDs of ingredients to be removed from the pizza (if any).
- The `extras` column lists the IDs of ingredients to be added to the pizza (if any).
- A single order (`order_id`) can include multiple pizzas, even of the same type, but with different topping customizations.
- The `exclusions` and `extras` columns may contain inconsistent data (e.g., `null`, `NaN`, or strings with multiple IDs separated by commas) and need to be cleaned before processing.

## **Table 3: runner_orders**
The `runner_orders` table tracks how orders are assigned to runners. Not all orders are completedâ€”some may be cancelled by either the restaurant or the customer.
- pickup_time records when the runner picks up the pizzas.
- distance and duration represent how far and how long the delivery took.
- There are known data quality issues in this table, so always check column data types before querying.

| order_id | runner_id | pickup_time           | distance  | duration     | cancellation            |

## **10. What was the volume of orders for each day of the week?**
```sql
WITH RECURSIVE cte AS (
  SELECT 0 AS day
  UNION ALL
  SELECT day + 1
  FROM cte
  WHERE day < 6
)

SELECT cte.day as day,  COUNT(CASE WHEN co.order_id IS NOT NULL THEN 1 END) as total_ordered
FROM cte
LEFT JOIN customer_orders co ON EXTRACT(DOW FROM order_time) = cte.day
GROUP BY  cte.day
ORDER BY cte.day
```
| day | total_ordered |
|-----|----------------|
| 0   | 0              |
| 1   | 0              |
| 2   | 0              |
| 3   | 5              |
| 4   | 3              |
| 5   | 1              |
| 6   | 5              |

# B. Runner and Customer Experience
## **5. What was the difference between the longest and shortest delivery times for all orders?**
```sql
SELECT MAX(duration) - MIN(duration) AS delivery_time_diff
FROM runner_orders_cleaned
```
| delivery_time_diff|
|-------------------|
| 30.00             |

## **1. How many runners signed up for each 1 week period? (i.e. week starts 2021-01-01)**
```sql
WITH RECURSIVE cte AS (
    SELECT 
        DATE '2021-01-01' AS start_date, 
        DATE '2021-01-01' + INTERVAL '6 days' AS end_date
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 
        (end_date + INTERVAL '1 day')::DATE, 
        (end_date + INTERVAL '7 days')::DATE
    FROM cte 
    WHERE end_date < DATE '2021-01-31'
)

SELECT
  ROW_NUMBER() OVER(ORDER BY start_date) AS week,
  start_date,
  end_date,
  SUM(CASE WHEN r.registration_date IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as total_runners_signed_up
FROM cte
LEFT JOIN runners r ON r.registration_date BETWEEN start_date AND end_date
GROUP BY start_date, end_date
```
| week | start_date          | end_date            | total_runners_signed_up |
|------|---------------------|---------------------|--------------------------|
| 1    | 2021-01-01          | 2021-01-07 00:00:00 | 2                        |
| 2    | 2021-01-08          | 2021-01-14 00:00:00 | 1                        |

## **2. What was the average time in minutes it took for each runner to arrive at the Pizza Runner HQ to pickup the order?**
```sql
SELECT
  r.runner_id, 
  ROUND(AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (r.pickup_time_cleaned::timestamp - c.order_time)) / 60)::numeric ,2) AS avg_minutes_diff
FROM customer_orders_cleaned c
LEFT JOIN runner_orders_cleaned r USING(order_id)
WHERE r.pickup_time_cleaned  IS NOT NULL AND r.cancellation_cleaned IS NULL
GROUP BY r.runner_id
```
| runner_id | avg_minutes_diff |
|-----------|------------------|
| 1         | 15.68            |
| 2         | 23.72            |
