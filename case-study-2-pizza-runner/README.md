# Case Study #2 - Pizza Runner
## **Table 1: runners**
The `runners` table shows the registration_date for each new runner

| runner_id | registration_date |
|-----------|-------------------|
| 1         | 2021-01-01        |
| 2         | 2021-01-03        |
| 3         | 2021-01-08        |
| 4         | 2021-01-15        |


## **Table 2: customer_orders**
The `customer_orders` table records pizza orders from customers, with each row representing an individual pizza in the order.

- The `pizza_id` column indicates the type of pizza ordered.
- The `exclusions` column lists the IDs of ingredients to be removed from the pizza (if any).
- The `extras` column lists the IDs of ingredients to be added to the pizza (if any).
- A single order (`order_id`) can include multiple pizzas, even of the same type, but with different topping customizations.
- The `exclusions` and `extras` columns may contain inconsistent data (e.g., `null`, `NaN`, or strings with multiple IDs separated by commas) and need to be cleaned before processing.

| order_id | customer_id | pizza_id | exclusions | extras  | order_time           |

## **Table 3: runner_orders**
The `runner_orders` table tracks how orders are assigned to runners. Not all orders are completedâ€”some may be cancelled by either the restaurant or the customer.
- pickup_time records when the runner picks up the pizzas.
- distance and duration represent how far and how long the delivery took.
- There are known data quality issues in this table, so always check column data types before querying.

| order_id | runner_id | pickup_time           | distance  | duration     | cancellation            |
